        <br /><br />Design research begins with the rigorous study of the people we serve and the context in their natural environment. It leads teams to continuously build a deep and rich understanding and empathy of people through observation and co-creation.
        <br /><br />Job-to-be-done research helps us to break down the user’s experience in discrete steps and to understand where and why the experience is not meeting the user’s needs.
