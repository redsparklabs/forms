        <br /><br />This phase is a combination of Design Research and Jobs To Be Done Research.
        <br /><br />Design research begins with the rigorous study of the people we serve and the context in their natural environment. It leads teams to continuously build a deep and rich understanding and empathy of people through observation and co-creation.
        <br /><br />Job-to-be-done research helps us to break down the user’s experience in discrete steps and to understand where and why the experience is not meeting the user’s needs. 
        <br /><br />The job-to-be-done is the ultimate unit of analysis to guide our decisions on who to target for value creation based on the unmet need and the context of it.',
